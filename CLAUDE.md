## Testing
The main task I am dealing with right now is I am writing test files for all of the different View/ COmponents files and their corresponding template, aka blade.php file. Component classes can be found at this file path: /home/trumanthomas/channel-lister/src/View/Components and templates can be found at this file path: /home/trumanthomas/channel-lister/resources/views/components. I am writing all of my tests in the /home/trumanthomas/channel-lister/tests/Feature/View/Components folder, and appending the word "Test" at the end of every component name like I have done with the previous tests I have written already. 

Could you please write tests for the other Components I have not written already? I would like you to follow the structure of the of the other test files I have already written: append the word "Test" at the end of each of the file names, do not use Mocking, use the blade function like the other tests are, have the class set up be the same structure as the other tests I have already written. 

Here is a list of the View/ Components I would like you to write test files for:

- View/Components/TextareaFormInput.php 
- View/Components/TextFormInput.php 
- View/Components/UrlFormInput.php
- View/Components/Custom/AmazonSpecialRefinements.php 
- View/Components/Custom/CalculatedShippingService.php 
- View/Components/Custom/CostShipping.php
- View/Components/Custom/FormInput.php
- View/Components/Custom/Label.php
- View/Components/Custom/ListedBy.php 
- View/Components/Custom/Prop65.php
- View/Components/Custom/SkuBundle.php 
- View/Components/Custom/SkuBundleComponentInputRow.php 
- View/Components/Custom/Upc.php
