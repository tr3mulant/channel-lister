## üìä Amazon SP-API Integration

Channel Lister features comprehensive Amazon Selling Partner API (SP-API) integration for dynamic listing creation. This powerful feature enables:

- Search for Amazon product types
- Fetch dynamic listing requirements from Amazon
- Look up existing listings by identifier (ASIN, GTIN, UPC, EAN, ISBN)
- Generate marketplace-specific forms dynamically

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Amazon SP-API Configuration
AMAZON_SP_API_BASE_URL=https://sellingpartnerapi-na.amazon.com
AMAZON_MARKETPLACE_ID=ATVPDKIKX0DER
AMAZON_SP_API_REGION=us-east-1
AMAZON_SP_API_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
AMAZON_SP_API_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
AMAZON_SP_API_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token_here
```

**Note**: The system now uses OAuth 2.0 with automatic token refresh. You only need to provide your client credentials and refresh token - access tokens are managed automatically.

### üìã Usage

1. **Product Type Search**: Use the Amazon product type search component to find and select the appropriate product type for your listing.

2. **Dynamic Form Generation**: Once a product type is selected, the system will fetch the listing requirements from Amazon SP-API and generate the appropriate form fields.

3. **Existing Listing Lookup**: Enter an identifier (ASIN, GTIN, etc.) to look up and pre-populate form fields from an existing Amazon listing.

### üîó API Endpoints

**Product Type & Requirements:**

- `POST /api/amazon-listing/search-product-types` - Search for Amazon product types
- `POST /api/amazon-listing/listing-requirements` - Get listing requirements for a product type
- `POST /api/amazon-listing/existing-listing` - Look up existing listing by identifier

**Form Submission & Management:**

- `POST /api/amazon-listing/submit` - Submit listing form data
- `POST /api/amazon-listing/validate` - Validate a listing
- `POST /api/amazon-listing/generate-file` - Generate CSV/JSON files
- `GET /api/amazon-listing/listings` - Get all listings with pagination
- `GET /api/amazon-listing/listings/{id}` - Get specific listing details
- `GET /api/amazon-listing/listings/{id}/download` - Download generated files

### üîê Token Management

The system includes robust SP-API token management with:

- **Automatic token refresh** - Tokens are refreshed automatically before expiration
- **Caching** - Valid tokens are cached to reduce API calls
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error handling for authentication failures
- **Rate limiting** - Built-in protection against API rate limits
- **Debugging** - Console command for checking token status

#### Debug Token Status

Use the console command to check your Amazon SP-API token status:

```bash
php artisan channel-lister:amazon-token-status

# Force refresh token
php artisan channel-lister:amazon-token-status --refresh
```

#### Authentication Flow

1. **Initial Setup**: Configure your client credentials and refresh token
2. **Automatic Management**: The system automatically obtains and refreshes access tokens
3. **Request Authentication**: All SP-API calls are automatically authenticated
4. **Error Recovery**: Failed authentication attempts trigger automatic token refresh

### üìù Form Submission Workflow

The system provides a complete workflow for creating Amazon listings:

#### 1. **Product Type Selection**

- Search and select appropriate Amazon product type
- System fetches dynamic listing requirements from SP-API
- Form fields are generated based on Amazon's current requirements

#### 2. **Form Completion**

- Fill out dynamically generated form fields
- Real-time validation feedback
- Progress tracking showing completion percentage
- Support for existing listing lookup and pre-population

#### 3. **Validation & Processing**

- **Save Draft**: Store form data without validation
- **Validate**: Comprehensive validation against Amazon requirements
- **Business Rules**: SKU uniqueness, price validation, dimension consistency
- **Required Fields**: Automatic detection of missing required fields

#### 4. **File Generation**

- **CSV Export**: Amazon-compatible CSV format for bulk upload
- **JSON Export**: Structured data for API integration
- **Field Mapping**: Automatic mapping to Amazon feed column names
- **Data Transformation**: Amazon-specific formatting (prices, dimensions, etc.)

#### 5. **Download & Submission**

- Secure file downloads with proper MIME types
- Files ready for Amazon Seller Central upload
- Persistent storage with listing history

### ‚úÖ Validation Features

- **Amazon Requirements**: Dynamic validation based on current SP-API requirements
- **Field Types**: String, numeric, boolean, enum validation
